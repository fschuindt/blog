excerpt: "It's Friday, sky is clear. I was willing to proceed with some stacking experiments, but the Moon glare was owning the night. I remembered I haven't yet took a Moon shot with the 300mm using the Canon, my last Moon (and only) shot was using the Olympus e410, so I saw on it a good chance. The Moon is almost full, but not yet. The remaining bit of penumbra is useful to reveal some terrain detail and I think it worked."

It's Friday, sky is clear. I was willing to proceed with some stacking experiments, but the Moon glare was owning the night. I remembered I haven't yet took a Moon shot with the 300mm using the Canon, my last Moon (and only) shot was using the Olympus e410, so I saw on it a good chance. The Moon is almost full, but not yet. The remaining bit of penumbra is useful to reveal some terrain detail and I think it worked.

Used APT to help me find the best focus (viewing on the computer's large screen helps a ton) and I took only a single light frame.

I think my Photoshop edit killed it, but I liked it anyway.
