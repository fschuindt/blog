excerpt: "My great friend Terry F. reminded me just yesterday about the Venus/Mercury conjunction of today. I wasn't hopeful at all due to the 'rainy season' here in Northeast Brazil, all these days have been raining a lot. But even so I had set up the alarm to ring for it. Luck was on my side, I had a hole of clear sky among the clouds, just enough to see the two planets. It didn't last long, but I was able to take some frames and elect one to be published."

My great friend Terry F. reminded me just yesterday about the Venus/Mercury conjunction of today. I wasn't hopeful at all due to the "rainy season" here in Northeast Brazil, all these days have been raining a lot. But even so I had set up the alarm to ring for it. Luck was on my side, I had a hole of clear sky among the clouds, just enough to see the two planets. It didn't last long, but I was able to take some frames and elect one to be published.

So obviously special thanks to Terry F. and to Catarina Dantas.
