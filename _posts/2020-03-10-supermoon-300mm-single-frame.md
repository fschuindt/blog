Just a simple quick shot straight out my backyard. I didn't wanted to miss the Supermoon without a picture. It's not the kind of event that thrills me, but still a nice thing. So here it is.

Special thanks to Terry F., who donated me a ton of equipment to learn about photography. Thank you, man!

This was taken using the donated DSLR and lens.
