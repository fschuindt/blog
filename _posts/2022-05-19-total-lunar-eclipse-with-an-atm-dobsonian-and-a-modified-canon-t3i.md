excerpt: "Capturing the total lunar eclipse with DSLR single frames and a homemade Newtonian telescope."

During the night of May 15th 2022, I went to the [SEASE](https://sease.org.br/) event for the total lunar eclipse at the [CCTECA Planetarium Galileu Galilei](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTECA_-_Galileu_Galilei), in Aracaju - SE, Brazil. I brought with me my [homemade 210mm f/6.62 Newtonian Dobsonian telescope](https://fschuindt.722.network/2020/10/18/kugelblitz-telescope.html) and some equipments. The Moon's FOV on the Canon T3i with that telescope is almost the entire frame, perfect for full-disk single frame photography. That was my first time photographing a lunar eclipse, so I wanted to keep things simple.

The event was really nice, a lot of people went to watch the Moon during its transformations for the night, and I spent a lot of time handling the telescope to the public. People of all ages saw the Moon through my telescope, and I was pleased to make some friends on the spot.

Many thanks to my friend Leandro who was with me all along and helped me during all the tasks, he was super. Also thanks to the SEASE for the space and reception.

Fun fact is that a few days after my picture appeared at the local news along with some others, you can watch it here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ834A3z2Bc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ834A3z2Bc)

Thanks to Augusto from SEASE for sending the pictures to them.
