excerpt: "My first attempt with DSLR Moon videos stacked into one picture."
---

Spent the night trying multiple combinations of ways to photograph the Moon. A mix between my Meade ETX90 (1250mm f/13.8), a Olympus film lens (300mm f/4.5), a Canon EOS 600D and a modified Logitech C270 webcam. Also experimented between recording videos and taking pictures.

My first impressions:
- The 300mm lens with a wide ocular can reveal M42 by eye, odd.
- The Moon is almost the entire frame of the C270 cam with the 300mm lens.
- The C270 cam is a good camera for surface images of the Moon with the ETX90. Haven't tried with barlows.
- The C270 cam reveals chromatic aberration on the 300mm lens.
- ETX90 90째 adapter is wobbling, this may be the reason for the partially-out-of-focus feeling I'm getting when using the DSLR due to weight.
- DSLR video seems to be the way to go instead of multiple exposures. Still need to try INDI the live-video feature with the DSLR.
