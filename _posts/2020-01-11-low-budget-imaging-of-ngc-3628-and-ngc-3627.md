*This post was originally published on my [old blog](https://boredprogrammer.postach.io/post/low-budget-imaging-of-ngc-3628-and-ngc-3627) dedicated to amateur astronomy.*

This one took me quite a good time to process, ended up making 3 versions of it and sticking with the latest. It's the first time I programmed a galaxy themed picture so my inexperience spoke during the whole process.

The plan was to put two or more galaxies in the frame with a low budget plan (the remaining usage time I had on iTelescope). I was aiming to the [Leo Triplet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Triplet), a group of 3 galaxies also known as the M66 group. But I was using a deep field telescope (0.43-m f/6.8 reflector + CCD + f/4.5 focal reducer) so I ended up taking just two of the three galaxies: [NGC 3628](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_3628) (the Hamburger Galaxy / M65 and [NGC 3627](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_66) (the M66).

The image composition is the following:

- 4x 30" Luminous frame
- 4x 30" Red frame
- 4x 30" Green frame
- 4x 30" Blue frame

The images were stacked using DeepSky Stacker and stretched using Adobe Photoshop.
