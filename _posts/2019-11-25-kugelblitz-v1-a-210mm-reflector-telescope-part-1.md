excerpt: "Me and Bruno went this morning to the construction store and bought a 6m long, 250mm diameter PVC pipe. We chopped it in 4 pieces of 1.5m so we can transport it. That would be the telescope tube, housing a 210mm primary mirror."

Me and Bruno went this morning to the construction store and bought a 6m long, 250mm diameter PVC pipe. We chopped it in 4 pieces of 1.5m so we can transport it. That would be the telescope tube, housing a 210mm primary mirror.

We also bought some spray paint cans, sandpaper, and other tools.

A guy named [Sebasti√£o Santiago Filho](https://www.telescopiosastronomicos.com.br/kits.html) is working to produce both primary and secondary mirrors. I expect it to be completed around December 20th this year. Meanwhile me and Bruno are gathering the material to start the production. We're going to wait for the mirror to get completed, so we can know its exact dimensions for focal length and etc.
