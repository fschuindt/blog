Also referred as [SICP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs), it's a well known MIT book published in the late 80's and used in the Computer Science and Electrical Engineering courses. Written by [Harold Abelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Abelson), [Gerald Jay Sussman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Jay_Sussman) and [Julie Sussman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Sussman). It's the definitive functional programming book.

It's available for free in many formats such as [HTML](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) and [PDF](https://github.com/sarabander/sicp-pdf/blob/master/sicp.pdf). This book insipred me to create this blog. It's just wonderful, it's the great grimoire of computer wizardry. But not only that, the [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/) has the whole [video lectures](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005) from 1986 taught by [Harold Abelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Abelson) and [Gerald Jay Sussman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Jay_Sussman) themselves, and with no cost.

>These twenty video lectures by Hal Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman are a complete presentation of the course, given in July 1986 for Hewlett-Packard employees, and professionally produced by Hewlett-Packard Television. These videos are also available here under a Creative Commons license compatible with commercial use.
>
>Note: These lectures follow the first edition (1985) of Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. Many of the programs discussed were rewritten for the second edition (1996) of the book, and new material was added. These video lectures will still be useful for students using the second edition, since the overall themes of the course and order of presentation are unchanged.

The book uses the language [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)) which is a [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) dialect, one of the oldest languages (*1959*) to teach pure functional concepts from the very basics to the more complex cases. It's like learning to program again from a pure functional perspective.

>This course introduces students to the principles of computation. Upon completion of 6.001, students should be able to explain and apply the basic methods from programming languages to analyze computational systems, and to generate computational solutions to abstract problems. Substantial weekly programming assignments are an integral part of the course. This course is worth 4 Engineering Design Points.

And here's the first lecture, just in case:
