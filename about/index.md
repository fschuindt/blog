    <p><strong>Fernando Schuindt</strong>, Brazilian, 25yo, software developer, bassist and amateur
    chess player. That's (in part) me.</p>

    <p>I've been playing with programming languages and operational systems since my
    childhood. Started with Linux and PHP when I was 12 and today I work remotely
    with Ruby on Rails at <a href="http://www.quezmedia.com/">Qu√©zMedia</a>.</p>

    <p>Recently I'm focusing my studies in functional programming and that's my blog
    about it. Here I will keep my personal notes, codes, and useful stuff I find in
    this journey.</p>
